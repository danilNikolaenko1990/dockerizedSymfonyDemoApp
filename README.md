I took Symfony demo application and put it into the Docker to show "dockerization" skills.
Also I replaced sqlite database with PostgreSQL.
Original Symfony Demo application is here: https://github.com/symfony/demo
     
To launch application 
go to 
``` build/dev``` directory and run 
```./start.sh```

Application is available at localhost/8080

Postgres admin panel is available at
localhost/8081
 * System - PostgreSQL
 * server - db
 * username - admin
 * password - admin
 * database - postgres
